# F0Talk - an advanced soundboard
## What's it?
This app is an advanced soundboard, that allows you not just to stream sounds but even to "voice chat" through terminal using GTTS. It can play sounds from a file, or an URL. The URL should be pointing to YouTube.com (MPV requires youtube-dl for this), or it should point to a file directly. Basically, the application may be used just in terminal (launch it without -g) as the GUI is just a shell.

## Installation
Download distribution from "releases" section. Install Google Chrome.

#### Windows:
1. Install VCable https://vb-audio.com/Cable/ 
2. Run **F0Talk.exe** itself, or **F0Talk GUI.bat**

#### Linux: 
1. Install **mpv** via pacman, apt or whatever. You can also install **youtube-dl**, if you want to play sounds directly from YouTube (that may be much slower than using local files).
2. Then, you have to deal with audio. You can run **vsink_t.sh** to get temporal VSink. If you want these changes to be permanent, you have to append the contents of **vsink.txt** to **/etc/pulse/default.pa**.

Now you can simply select the desired audio output through the GUI of the app.

## Usage short tour
* Use **play** to play a sound from file or URL
* **bind** to bind a command to another command or a command sequence, so you can access it easier
* **kbind** to bind a command to a key
* **&lt;language&gt;** is for TTS (it uses GTTS to say text, language aliases come from Google too)
* The hidden commands **e** (us layout) and **Ñ€** (Russian layout) are for TTS in English and Russian
